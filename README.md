# Tagging-Project-for-Machine-Learning-Natural-Language-Processing
This project was originally developed at the Brain Research Tagging project where we were tagging research articles according to brain research categories. The Brain Research Tagging Project, a collaboration between NAMI Montana and Montana State University (MSU). The project was developed by Dr. Indika Kahanda and Shriyansh Kothari of Montana State University with Matt Kuntz of NAMI Montana.

The Brain Research Tagging Project involves "tagging," or classifying, current brain research articles based upon the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria. This project eventually evolved into a task at the 2019 BioNLP Open Shared Tasks (BioNLP-OST: http://2019.bionlp-ost.org) Find out more about that project at this link. https://sites.google.com/view/rdoc-task

The system developed for tagging these brain research articles allows for a great combination of education for the people doing the tagging while crowdsourcing massive tagging projects for natural language processing machine learning. The goal of this effort is to make that code available to others doing NLP projects.

All of the coding on this project was done by Abdul Rehman Yousaf. We are honored ot have him as a key collaborator for this Github repository.
